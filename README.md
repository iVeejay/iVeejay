## 📝 About Me
I'm a multidisciplinary developer and designer driven by curiosity and a love for innovation. My journey started with simple code experiments, but it quickly evolved into a full-blown passion for crafting immersive digital experiences. Whether I'm building responsive websites, designing user interfaces, or animating ideas in Blender, I’m always pushing myself to create work that feels both intuitive and impactful.
